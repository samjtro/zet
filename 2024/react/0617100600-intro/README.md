# intro to react/npm

## what is node?

## what is react?

## how does it work?

you have an app, that gets initialized at the entry point (typically index.js), which is routed via whichever router you use.

react apps are just nested components, components are just js functions that return html. react components are styled via html tags.

components "remember" things via state. the react function useState(initialState) sets [value, setValue] consts.
