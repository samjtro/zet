## motivations and mindset

growth mindset: someone who believes they can get better at anything with effort+persistence

struggling = growth

### learning process

projects = the ultimate method for ensuring theoretical understanding == actuality

focus mode: conscious focus on learning, reading, watching, working

take a break to refresh and let your subconcious work on making connections

understand, practice & teach it

## how the web works

computers connected via a network of undersea cables, locally/regionally connected via fiberoptic
