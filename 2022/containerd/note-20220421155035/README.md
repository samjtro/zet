kubernetes is phasing out support for docker-ce: what is the solution

0. not to abandon docker -- docker is still an incredibly important tool, dockerfiles and docker compose will continue to be just as useful as before
1. containerd is a viable container alternative to docker with more options for container creation -- not as user friendly
2. nerdctl (maybe) attempts to fix this issue
