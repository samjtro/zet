## web app structure

upon going to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/ in your browser, you send a GET request to the server hosting https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/ which, subsequently sends back the HTML file which your browser knows to display

the HTML code contains an img tag, which then generates a second GET to the img src
