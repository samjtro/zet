# does go have a pandas alternative for data

the pandas library is an excellent data science library that allows for very quick manipulation of large series of data. i am very much hoping that go has a reasonable alternative to this.

haven't seen much so far, but i assume like everything in this language i will be pleasently surprised.

hoping...
